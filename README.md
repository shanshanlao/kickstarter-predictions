The task for this assignment is to use the Kickstarter dataset to:

1. Develop a classification model to predict whether the variable "state" will take the value "successful" or "failure." 
   
   Note the classification task is assumed to be done at the time each project is launched. 

2. Develop a clustering model to group projects together. 

Concepts Involved:
- Classification
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNN
  - CART
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Artifical Neural Network
  - Suppor Vector Machine
  
- Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - K-means Clustering
  - Isolation Forest
